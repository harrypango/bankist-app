# Bankist - Bank App

LOGIN CREDENTIALS:  
USER 1 - username: hp / pw: 1111  
USER 2 - username: jd / pw: 2222

Bankist is a simple app, that focuses solely on core functionalities, rather than the design aspect of a web app.
Use the above login credentials to start using the app and take on different actions, such as: transferring money in between accounts, requesting loans,
which have a small delay since they have to be approved by the bank, just like in the real world :)

You can also choose to close the account if you wish to, but will have to refresh the page to re-activate it.

The app also covers some other functionalities, like:  
1 - an inactivity timer, which logs the user out after no actions have been taken in the last 2 minutes  
2 - a sum of the current balance and a sum of all incoming, outgoing transactions and total interest accrued  
3 - a sorting function  
4 - an exact date of when the action was executed

Have fun!
